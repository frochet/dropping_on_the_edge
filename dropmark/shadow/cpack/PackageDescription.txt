Shadow is a unique discrete-event network simulator that runs real-life applications like Tor. Shadow combines the accuracy of emulation with the efficiency and control of simulation, achieving the best of both approaches. Shadow runs real applications as plug-ins by intercepting and re-routing select system calls through the simulator, making it useful for multi-node applications on a single machine.
