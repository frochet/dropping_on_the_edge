# Disclaimer - Do not ignore!

The ShadowTor topologies in this directory are provided only
for convenience. The Tor codebase is changing rapidly, and the
configurations provided may produce significantly different
results when using different Tor releases.

Although the configurations are useful for testing purposes,
they should not be considered accurate and are likely not
suitable for carrying out important Tor research.

You have been warned. Use at your own risk.

If you are doing research that you intend to publish, or otherwise
need rigorous results, we **strongly** recommend that you generate
your own ShadowTor configurations using our existing tools. This
will ensure not only that your private network is based on the most
recent Tor network metrics, but also that you better understand
how real data is used to model Tor.

Instructions for generating a new ShadowTor configuration are here:
