This is chutney.  It doesn't do much so far.  It isn't ready for prime-time.

If it breaks, you get to keep all the pieces.

It is supposed to be a good tool for:
  - Configuring a testing tor network
  - Launching and monitoring a testing tor network
  - Running tests on a testing tor network

Right now it only sorta does these things.

You will need, at the moment:
  - Tor installed somewhere in your path, or
  - The location of the 'tor' and 'tor-gencert' binaries specified through the
    environment variables CHUTNEY_TOR and CHUTNEY_TOR_GENCERT, respectively, or
  - To run chutney's tools/test-network.sh from a tor build directory, and
  - Python 2.7 or later (Python 3 support is an ongoing work)

Stuff to try:

Automated Setup, Verification, and Shutdown:
  ./tools/test-network.sh --flavor basic-min
  ./tools/test-network.sh --coverage
  ./tools/test-network.sh --tor-path <tor-build-directory>
  ./tools/test-network.sh --tor <name-or-path> --tor-gencert <name-or-path>
  (--tor-path and $TOR_DIR override --tor and --tor-gencert.)
  (The script tries hard to find tor.)
  ./tools/test-network.sh --chutney-path <chutney-directory>
  (The script is pretty good at finding chutney.)

test-network.sh looks for some tor binaries (either in a nearby build
directory or in your $PATH), configures a comprehensive tor test network,
launches it, then verifies data transmission through it, and cleans up after
itself. Relative paths are supported.

You can modify its configuration using command-line arguments, or use the
chutney environmental variables documented below:

Timing Options:
  --start-time       CHUTNEY_START_TIME
  --bootstrap-time   CHUTNEY_BOOTSTRAP_TIME
  --stop-time        CHUTNEY_STOP_TIME

Traffic Options:
  --data             CHUTNEY_DATA_BYTES=N
  # connections are simultaneous, rounds are sequential
  --connections      CHUTNEY_CONNECTIONS=N
  --rounds           CHUTNEY_ROUNDS=N
  --hs-multi-client  CHUTNEY_HS_MULTI_CLIENT=N

Address Options:
  --ipv4             CHUTNEY_LISTEN_ADDRESS
  --ipv6             CHUTNEY_LISTEN_ADDRESS_V6

Warning Options:
  --all-warnings     CHUTNEY_WARNINGS_IGNORE_EXPECTED=false
                     CHUTNEY_WARNINGS_SUMMARY=false
  --no-warnings      CHUTNEY_WARNINGS_SKIP=true
  --only-warnings    CHUTNEY_WARNINGS_ONLY=true

Expert Options:
  --debug            CHUTNEY_DEBUG=true
  --coverage         USE_COVERAGE_BINARY=true
  --dry-run          NETWORK_DRY_RUN=true
  --quiet            ECHO=true

  --controlling-pid  CHUTNEY_CONTROLLING_PID
  --net-dir          CHUTNEY_DATA_DIR
  (These are advanced options: in the past, they have had long-standing bugs.)

Standard Actions:
  ./chutney configure networks/basic
  ./chutney start networks/basic
  ./chutney status networks/basic
  ./chutney verify networks/basic
  ./chutney hup networks/basic
  ./chutney stop networks/basic

Bandwidth Tests:
  ./chutney configure networks/basic-min
  ./chutney start networks/basic-min
  ./chutney status networks/basic-min
  CHUTNEY_DATA_BYTES=104857600 ./chutney verify networks/basic-min
  # Send 100MB of data per client connection
  # verify produces performance figures for:
  # Single Stream Bandwidth: the speed of the slowest stream, end-to-end
  # Overall tor Bandwidth: the sum of the bandwidth across each tor instance
  # This approximates the CPU-bound tor performance on the current machine,
  # assuming everything is multithreaded and network performance is infinite.
  ./chutney stop networks/basic-min

Connection Tests:
  ./chutney configure networks/basic-025
  ./chutney start networks/basic-025
  ./chutney status networks/basic-025
  # Make 5 simultaneous connections from each client through a random exit
  CHUTNEY_CONNECTIONS=5 ./chutney verify networks/basic-025
  ./chutney stop networks/basic-025

  # Run 5 sequential verification rounds
  CHUTNEY_ROUNDS=5 ./tools/test-network.sh --flavour basic

Note: If you create 7 or more connections to a hidden service from a single
Tor 0.2.7 client, you'll likely get a verification failure due to #15937.
This is fixed in 0.2.8.

HS Connection Tests:
  ./chutney configure networks/hs-025
  ./chutney start networks/hs-025
  ./chutney status networks/hs-025
  CHUTNEY_HS_MULTI_CLIENT=1 ./chutney verify networks/hs-025
  # Make a connection from each client to each hs
  # Default behavior is one client connects to each HS
  ./chutney stop networks/hs-025

Waiting for the network:

  The tools/test-network.sh script waits CHUTNEY_START_TIME seconds
  (default: 20) before calling chutney verify, because that's the minimum
  amount of time it takes to bootstrap a consensus containing relays.
  (It takes 5-10 seconds for the authorities to create the first consensus,
  then 10 seconds for relays to bootstrap, submit their descriptors, and be
  included in the next consensus.) If CHUTNEY_START_TIME is negative, the
  script leaves the network running, and exits immediately (without verifying).

  Commands like "chutney verify" start immediately, and keep trying for
  CHUTNEY_BOOTSTRAP_TIME seconds (default: 60). If it hasn't been
  successful after that time, it fails. If CHUTNEY_BOOTSTRAP_TIME is negative,
  the script leaves the network running, and exits after CHUTNEY_START_TIME
  (without verifying).

  The tools/test-network.sh script waits CHUTNEY_STOP_TIME seconds
  after verifying, then exits (default: immediately). If CHUTNEY_STOP_TIME is
  negative, the script leaves the network running, and exits after verifying.

  If none of these options are negative, test-network.sh tells the tor
  processes to exit after it exits, using CHUTNEY_CONTROLLING_PID. To disable
  this functionality, set CHUTNEY_CONTROLLING_PID to 1 or less.

Changing the network address:

   Chutney defaults to binding to localhost. To change the IPv4 bind address,
   set the CHUTNEY_LISTEN_ADDRESS environment variable. Similarly, change
   CHUTNEY_LISTEN_ADDRESS_V6 for IPv6: it defaults to "no IPv6 address".
   Setting it to some interface's IP address allows us to make the simulated
   Tor network available on the network.

   IPv6 support for both Tor and Chutney is a work in progress. Currently,
   chutney verifies IPv6 client, bridge client (?), hidden service, and exit
   connections. It does not use IPv6 SOCKSPorts or HiddenServicePorts.

The configuration files:
  networks/basic holds the configuration for the network you're configuring
  above.  It refers to some torrc template files in torrc_templates/.

The working files:
  chutney sticks its working files, including all data directories, log
  files, etc, in ./net/.  Each tor instance gets a subdirectory of net/nodes.

  You can override the directory "./net" with the CHUTNEY_DATA_DIR
  environment variable.

Test scripts:
  The test scripts are stored in the "scripts/chutney_tests" directory. These
  Python files must define a "run_test(network)" function. Files starting with
  an underscore ("_") are ignored.

  Test scripts can be run using the following syntax:
  ./chutney <script-name> networks/<network-name>

  The chutney verify command is implemented using a test script.

  Test scripts in the test directory with the same name as standard commands
  are run instead of that standard command. This allows expert users to replace
  the standard chutney commands with modified versions.
