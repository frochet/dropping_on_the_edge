"""
  This module contins a general-purpose specialization-based
  templating mechanism.  Chutney uses it for string-substitution to
  build torrc files and other such things.

  First, there are a few classes to implement "Environments".  An
  "Environment" is like a dictionary, but delegates keys that it can't
  find to a "parent" object, which can be an environment or a dict.

>>> base = Environ(foo=99, bar=600)
>>> derived1 = Environ(parent=base, bar=700, quux=32)
>>> base["foo"]
99
>>> sorted(base.keys())
['bar', 'foo']
>>> derived1["foo"]
99
>>> base["bar"]
600
>>> derived1["bar"]
700
>>> derived1["quux"]
32
>>> sorted(derived1.keys())
['bar', 'foo', 'quux']

    You can declare an environment subclass with methods named
    _get_foo() to implement a dictionary whose 'foo' item is
    calculated on the fly.

>>> class Specialized(Environ):
...    def __init__(self, p=None, **kw):
...       Environ.__init__(self, p, **kw)
...    def _get_expensive_value(self, my):
...       return "Let's pretend this is hard to compute"
...
>>> s = Specialized(base, quux="hi")
>>> s["quux"]
'hi'
>>> s['expensive_value']
"Let's pretend this is hard to compute"
>>> sorted(s.keys())
['bar', 'expensive_value', 'foo', 'quux']

   There's an internal class that extends Python's string.Template
   with a slightly more useful syntax for us.  (It allows more characters
   in its key types.)

>>> bt = _BetterTemplate("Testing ${hello}, $goodbye$$, $foo , ${a:b:c}")
>>> bt.safe_substitute({'a:b:c': "4"}, hello=1, goodbye=2, foo=3)
'Testing 1, 2$, 3 , 4'

   Finally, there's a Template class that implements templates for
   simple string substitution.  Variables with names like $abc or
   ${abc} are replaced by their values; $$ is replaced by $, and
   ${include:foo} is replaced by the contents of the file "foo".

>>> t = Template("${include:/dev/null} $hi_there")
>>> sorted(t.freevars())
['hi_there']
>>> t.format(dict(hi_there=99))
' 99'
>>> t2 = Template("X$${include:$fname} $bar $baz")
>>> t2.format(dict(fname="/dev/null", bar=33, baz="$foo", foo=1337))
'X 33 1337'
>>> sorted(t2.freevars({'fname':"/dev/null"}))
['bar', 'baz', 'fname']

class Environ(_DictWrapper):

    """An 'Environ' is used to define a set of key-value mappings with a
       fall-back parent Environ.  When looking for keys in the
       Environ, any keys not found in this Environ are searched for in
       the parent.

       >>> animal = Environ(mobile=True,legs=4,can_program=False,
                            can_meow=False)
       >>> biped = Environ(animal,legs=2)

       True
       >>> cat['legs']
       4
       >>> cat['can_meow']
       True

       You can extend Environ to support values calculated at run-time by
       defining methods with names in the format _get_KEY():

       >>> class HomeEnv(Environ):
       ...    def __init__(self, p=None, **kw):
       ...       Environ.__init__(self, p, **kw)
       ...    def _get_dotemacs(self, my):
       ...       return os.path.join(my['homedir'], ".emacs")
       >>> h = HomeEnv(homedir="/tmp")
       >>> h['dotemacs']
       '/tmp/.emacs'

       The 'my' argument passed to these functions is the top-level
       dictionary that we're using for our lookup.  This is useful
       when defining values that depend on other values which might in
       turn be overridden:

       >>> class Animal(Environ):
       ...    def __init__(self, p=None, **kw):
       ...       Environ.__init__(self, p, **kw)
       ...    def _get_limbs(self, my):
       ...       return my['legs'] + my['arms']
       >>> a = Animal(legs=2,arms=2)
       >>> spider = Environ(a, legs=8,arms=0)
       >>> squid = Environ(a, legs=0,arms=10)
       >>> squid['limbs']
       10
       >>> spider['limbs']
       8

       Note that if _get_limbs() had been defined as
          'return self['legs']+self['arms']',
       both spider['limbs'] and squid['limbs'] would be given
       (incorrectly) as 4.
